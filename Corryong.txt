<hr>
  <p>The township of Corryong is located along the border of New South Wales and Victoria and was straddled by several fires during the 2019-2020 bushfire season. During the peak of the crisis, there were concerns that a 'megablaze' could form with a 10 km buffer separating the fires along the border in New South Wales and Victoria <a href="References.html">(McArthur, Waters & Simonis, 2020)<a/></p>
  <p>The town was in the path of the <b>Green Valley fire</b> with fears that the <b>East Ournie Creek fire</b> and the <b>Dunns Road fire</b> would combine to create a 'megablaze' <a href="References.html">(Drevikovsky, 2020)</a>.</p>
  <p> Over <b>800, 000 hectares</b> of land was burned from these three fires <a href="References.html">(Drevikovsky, 2020)</a>. 
  <p> The image below displays the extent of the fires in the region, as well as a timeline regarding their formation and movement. </p>

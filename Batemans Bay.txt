  <p>Batemans Bay is a regional town known for its natural beauty and is located only a four hours drive from Sydney and 2 hours drive from Canberra <a href="References.html">(VisitNSW, 2020)</a>.</p>
  <p>During the 2019/2020 summer bushfire season, the town was under threat from a large firefront. The map to the left by the <a href="References.html">NSW Rural Fire Service (2019)</a> shows the extent of the area burnt with the town located in the direct path of the fires.</p> 
  <p>Fortunately the town and communities remained relatively untouched by the fires, however the surrounding landscapes and national parks were heavily affected <a href="References.html">(Burnside, 2020)</a>.</p>

  <p>The town was under the looming threat of the fires with the picture below showing dismayed residents sheltering on the beach.</p>

The video below captured scenes in the town with the firefront heading towards the urban area. The sky was full of smoke, causing the sky to have an orange hue.
